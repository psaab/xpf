# pkg/logging

Multi-backend structured logging. Wraps `slog.Handler` with syslog
routing, a ring-buffer event subscription stream (consumed by the SSE
endpoint and the CLI's `monitor` commands), local file streaming with
facility/severity filtering, and a per-IP session aggregator for top-N
reports.

## Entry points

- `SyslogSlogHandler` — `slog_handler.go`. Slog handler that
  fans events out to configured syslog clients.
- `EventBuffer` — `eventbuf.go`. `NewEventBuffer(size int)` — the
  caller picks the size; `pkg/daemon/daemon_run.go` constructs it
  with 1000. Bounded ring; full → drops the oldest entry.
- `Subscription` — `eventbuf.go`. A consumer of the event ring.
- `LocalLogWriter` — `locallog.go`. File-based writer with
  facility/severity filters.
- `SessionAggregator` — `aggregator.go`. Top-N per-IP rollups.

## Callers

`pkg/daemon`, `pkg/api`, `pkg/grpcapi`, `pkg/flowexport`, `pkg/cli`.

## Dependencies

`pkg/config`, `pkg/dataplane`.

## Logging rules (CLAUDE.md authoritative)

- Use `slog.Debug` for high-frequency or per-packet diagnostics. Use
  `slog.Info` only for state transitions and one-time events.
- The HA watchdog sync was previously logging at `slog.Info` 15 times per
  second, drowning out real diagnostics. Don't reintroduce that pattern.
- Never put `slog.Info` inside per-session, per-packet, or per-poll-tick
  loops.

## Gotchas

- The binary RT_FLOW format used by Junos session logging is custom; it
  is not human-readable without a parser. Use the local-log facility for
  human-readable session events.
- The event buffer is bounded. If a subscriber stops draining, new events
  drop silently — by design. Don't wire a slow consumer to it.
- The session aggregator flushes on a 5-minute timer. The flushed
  snapshot is the basis for `show security session aggregate`.
