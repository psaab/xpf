# pkg/api

HTTP REST API on `127.0.0.1:8080`. Read-only access to system state plus
operational commands (clear, ping, traceroute). Health probes for
liveness/readiness. Prometheus metrics endpoint. SSE event streams.

## Entry points

- `Server` — `server.go`
- `NewServer(cfg Config) *Server` — `server.go`.
- `Config` — `server.go`. All dependencies (configstore, dataplane, frr,
  vrrp, etc.) injected here; the package has no global state.

## Surface

- `GET /health` — liveness/readiness. `CompileHealthFn` (#758) lets the
  daemon downgrade `/health` to 503 when a recent compile failed
  silently; without the callback it defaults to 200.
- `GET /metrics` — Prometheus exposition.
- `GET /api/v1/...` — REST mirrors of the gRPC API: sessions, routes,
  NAT, DHCP, IPsec, VRRP, OSPF, BGP, etc.
- `GET /api/v1/events/stream` — Server-Sent Events stream of dataplane
  events. Backed by the `pkg/logging` event ring buffer; long-lived
  consumers must drain.

## Callers

`cmd/xpfd` builds the `Server` from its assembled dependencies and runs it
under the daemon's errgroup. Nothing else imports this package.

## Dependencies

`config`, `configstore`, `conntrack`, `dataplane`, `dhcp`, `frr`, `ipsec`,
`logging`, `routing`, `vrrp`.

## Gotchas

- The status-poll path (1 Hz) shares the userspace dataplane control socket
  with HA sync, session installs, snapshot sync, and forwarding sync.
  Adding a new caller at >1 Hz here will starve session installs during
  bulk sync (per CLAUDE.md control-socket rules).
- The SSE handler reads from `pkg/logging.EventBuffer`. The buffer is
  bounded; if a consumer stops reading, events are dropped silently — by
  design.
- `CompileHealthFn` may be `nil` when the daemon is in `-no-dataplane`
  mode. All readyz code paths null-check it.
